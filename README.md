# Offline-Signature-Verification-System-Using-Image-Processing-and-Feature-Extraction-Techniques
This project presents a comprehensive offline signature verification system utilizing advanced image processing techniques. By segmenting signatures into 64 cells, the system calculates centroids, black-to-white transitions, aspect ratios, and evaluates skew and slant angles. Implemented in Python using libraries like PIL, NumPy, and SciPy, this solution enhances the accuracy of signature verification. Its potential applications span banking, identity verification, and forensic analysis, making it a valuable contribution to the field.
